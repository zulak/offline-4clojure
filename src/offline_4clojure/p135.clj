;; Infix Calculator - Easy
;; Your friend Joe is always whining about Lisps using the prefix notation for math. Show him how you could easily write a function that does math using the infix notation. Is your favorite language that flexible, Joe?
;;
;;Write a function that accepts a variable length mathematical expression consisting of numbers and the operations +, -, *, and /. Assume a simple calculator that does not do precedence and instead just calculates left to right.
